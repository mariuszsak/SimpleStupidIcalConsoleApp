# Simple Stupid Icalendar Console Application

There is just a simple stupid Icalendar console application. 
The application would be create the file out.ics with proper iCalendar structure. 

I have assumed that all values passing to the application would be valid.


#### Todo:

- date and time format validation
- unit tests
